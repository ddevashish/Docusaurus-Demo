## About

Projects are a new way to manage your flow files. They represent everything you need to create a distributable package.

They are backed by a Git repository, meaning all of the files are fully version controlled and allow developers to use familiar workflows to collaborate with others.

To setup ignite in the local system, please follow the [steps](/docs/getting-started/try-ignite/deploy-an-app/deploy-to-local/how-to-setup).
