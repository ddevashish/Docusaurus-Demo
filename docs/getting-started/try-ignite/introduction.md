## About

Just like Ignite, we have simplified deployment processes for various cloud providers like AWS, Azure, Heroku.

Your completely functional Ignite runtime is just few clicks away. A user can deploy as many apps they want for their project pipelines.

## How to Deploy

Go to our [runtime page](https://github.com/Cybergroup-Research/ignite-runtime-image) and click the button that has the name of your cloud provider.

If you don't see a link for your cloud provider, you can follow the instructions on the Readme file to deploy an app (Updated regularly).
